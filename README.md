🪄 You have reached @AstraTriesGit's _Domain Expansion: Infinite Repos!_  🪄                
Within this Domain, you will find projects on as many topics
as there is knowledge in the world. One day, some of them will
be complete, and the knowledge from infinity will manifest in the
real world, benefiting all of humankind.        
📅 As of the time period January 2024-May 2024,         
- 💻 self-projects on **distributed systems, functional programming, parallel programming and classic data structures and algorithms** are being worked on.    
- 🔭 **Haskell, C++ (high performant, embedded, concurrent), OS concurrency, .NET and distributed systems** are being learnt.
- 🛠️ I aim to work on more open source projects, especially those involving **.NET applications.**

The owner of this domain can be contacted at some other point in time.
